# METAGEM


METAGEM (META-analysis of GEM summary statistics) is a software program for meta-analysis of large-scale gene-environment interaction testing results, including multi-exposure interactions, joint (main effect and interactions) tests, and marginal tests. It uses results directly from [GEM](https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/GEM) output.


Current version: 1.0

### Input Files

METAGEM accepts output files from GEM (v1.4.1 or later) with '--output-style' set to 'meta' or 'full'. Multiple GEM output files can be specified using the '--input-files' flag, separated by spaces. Alternatively, the '--input-file-list' option can be used to specify a text file without headers, where each line contains a single input file name.

<br />

### Output File

METAGEM will write results to the output file specified with the --out parameter (or 'metagem.out' if no output file is specified).
Below are details of the possible column headers in the output file.

```diff

Cov_Beta_G_G-*     - Covariance(s) between the summary genetic main effect (G) estimate and the summary GxE interaction effect estimate(s) from joint meta-analysis using model-based results from each study.  
Cov_Beta_G-*_G-*   - Covariance(s) between the summary GxE interaction effect estimate(s) from joint meta-analysis using model-based results from each study.
robust_Beta_G      - The summary genetic main effect (G) estimate from joint (main effect and interactions) meta-analysis using robust results from each study.
robust_Beta_G-*    - The summary GxE interaction effect estimate(s) from joint (main effect and interactions) meta-analysis using robust results from each study.
robust_SE_Beta_G   - SE for the summary genetic main effect (G) estimate from joint meta-analysis using robust results from each study.  
robust_SE_Beta_G-* - SE for the summary GxE interaction effect estimate(s) from joint meta-analysis using robust results from each study.
robust_Cov_Beta_G_G-*   - Covariance(s) between the summary genetic main effect (G) estimate and the summary GxE interaction effect estimate(s) from joint meta-analysis using robust results from each study.

P_Value_Marginal           - The summary marginal genetic effect test p-value from univariate meta-analysis using model-based results from each study.
P_Value_Interaction        - The summary GxE interaction effect test p-value (K degrees of freedom test) from joint (main effect and interactions) meta-analysis using model-based results from each study. (K is the number of GxE interaction terms)

```

<br />

The '--meta-option' flag can be used to specify which columns should be included in the output file:

* 0 - Meta-analyses will be performed on both model-based and robust results from each study, and all column headers listed above will be available in the output file.
* 1 - Only model-based results from each study will be used in the meta-analysis, and columns above containing the 'robust_' prefix will be excluded from the output file.
* 2 - Only robust results from each study will be used in the meta-analysis, and summary statistics columns above without the 'robust_' prefix will be excluded from the output file.
* Default: 0 
 
<br />

The '--additional-joint' flag can be used to define an additional joint meta-analysis. The name(s) of the exposure(s) which will be included in the additional joint meta-analysis should be listed. The full path of the output file of the additional joint meta-analysis should be specified after the exposure name(s).

The '--additional-interaction' flag can be used to define an additional interaction-only meta-analysis. The name(s) of exposure(s) which will be included in the additional interaction-only meta-analysis should be listed. The full path of the output file of the additional interaction-only meta-analysis should be specified after the exposure name(s).

For an example situation which has a total of 2 covariates (cov1 and cov2) in the full meta-analysis, an additional joint meta-analysis with cov1 as exposure can be defined as:
```unix
--additional-joint cov1 metagem2.out
```
An additional interaction-only meta-analysis with cov1 as exposure can be defined as:
```unix
--additional-interaction cov1 metagem2.out
```

<br />

The '--control-file' flag can be used to specify all the input file names, and change the column name(s) of any input file that has different header name(s) with the standard GEM output file. All the input file names should be specified in different lines of the control file with a 'FILE' in front of the file names. For each file that need to change any column name, the pairs of the changed column name (i.e. the standard GEM output file header name) and the original column name should be specified in the following lines of the file name, with each pair a line. If this flag is used, then the '--input-files' flag and the '--input-file-list' flag should not be used.  

An example of a control file containing 3 files, and need to change 2 header names for the first file:
```unix
FILE file1.out
SNPID ID
CHR chromosome
FILE file2.out
FILE file3.out
```

<br />

### Example with the main test:
```unix
./METAGEM --input-files file1.out file2.out file3.out --exposure-names cov1 cov2 --out metagem.out
```
<br />

### Example with the main test and additional tests:
```unix
./METAGEM --input-files file1.out file2.out file3.out --exposure-names cov1 cov2 --out metagem1.out --additional-joint cov1 metagem2.out --additional-interaction cov1 metagem3.out
```
